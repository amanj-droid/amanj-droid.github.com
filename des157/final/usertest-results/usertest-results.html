            <h2>User Test One</h2>
            <p>
                During my first user test, the user did not quite understand how the hover effect worked. She scrolled
                down the page and the mouse happened to be over the hover area. This leads me to think that I should
                include some sort of indication that I have that feature. I could include a little explanation on the
                landing page or perhaps I could include an animation around the photo border. I could have a pulsating
                border around the border so that it grabs the user's interest and then they mouse over. She also pointed
                out that I needed to include my email in the footer.

            <h2>User Test Two</h2>
            <p>
                During my second user test, the user didn't have any trouble understanding how the page worked. At
                first, her cursor happened to be on the same x axis as the hover areas. She soon realized that her
                cursor was activating the image source change. She also thought it was a nice suprise that the images
                were interactive.

                A good suggestion that I recieved was to include a 'back to top' button so that the user doesn't have to
                scroll all the way up. This will definitely help the user experience since allows the user to move
                quicker around the page.

                Back to top button, gradient matching, remove 'Illustrations'

            <h2>User Test Three</h2>
            <p>
                User number three liked the location of the scroll progress bar. Something that could be improved is the
                white space around the images before they are activated. I'm not sure how I would fix this since I can't
                resize the images too much because it would create a load issue. At first, the user didn't understand
                how the images were activated, however, by the time he got to the third image he realized. After
                thinking a little while, he decided that the surprise adds to the experience. I think it wouldn't hurt
                to write 'Scroll and Hover' instead of 'Scroll' on the landing page.
