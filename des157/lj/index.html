            <h2>Best Practices for Form Design</h2>

                The article <em>Best Practices for Form Design</em> by Salim Ansari provides insightful pointers in creating a user-friendly digital form. Number three on Salim's list is creating multiple steps for the user. This one stood out to me because it isn't something that I have thought about before. Giving the user checkpoints in a form will help them feel progress. I think creating multiple steps is crucial for long forms because users are generally intimidated by long forms. Breaking down the content of the form will ultimately help the user digest all the information with minimal cognitive load.

                There is a lot more psychology behind forms than I had initially thought. For example, if you want the user to complete a form you want to give them easier information first. This will help the user gain momentum and eventually commit themselves to finish it. Forms can be intimidating, so allowing the user to start the form with easier questions first will go a long way.

                The final and perhaps the most important addition to forms is readability. Allowing the user to adjust the text size to something more suitable will help them comfortably complete a form. This irons out some of the accessibility issues people might have, such as visual impairment. For forms to be useful, they need to be suitable for every sort of person. Taking into account accessibility issues will ultimately help researchers gather more accurate data.

This form takes the user through a low cognitive load interface that will ultimately lead them to their desired destination.
