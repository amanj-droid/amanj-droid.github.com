        <h2>Project Summary</h2>
        <p>
            My webpage will serve as an illustration portfolio for my artworks from over the past 5 years. I want the
            content
            of this page to feel just as dynamic as the parallaxed hero image illustration. I will remove the slideshow
            javascript from my studio 2 and replace it with a scroll listener for each image.

            <p>
                Apple's webpage for their iPhone 12 Pro displays their product in a super visually appealing fashion.
                From top to bottom, the webpage displays the content according to the user's scroll position in the
                window. The interface is very dynamic in the way it displays images. The dark background accentuates the
                iPhone's metallic features. The only downside to having these incredibly high-resolution images is the
                load times. The high-quality images come at a cost as seen in the network tab in google chrome's
                inspector tool. After a hard reload, the webpage takes a total of 5.66s for my wifi. For user standards,
                that's a few seconds too long. I'm unsure if this can be helped because the whole purpose of the webpage
                is to see the detail of the iPhone 12. There's no way to do that unless the resolution was incredibly
                high.

            <p>
                Similarly, Chandon Garden also has poor load times. Using the google chromes inspector tool, the network
                tab shows me the page takes 6.61 seconds to load under my wifi. Unfortunately, most users are far too
                impatient to wait that long for a webpage to load. However, I think the beauty of the webpage makes up
                for the load times. The seamless animation with the Chandon Sprite bottle is addicting to watch. As the
                user scrolls down the webpage, the bottle spins and moves down with the user. What I find particularly
                interesting is the way the scroll position bounces into a locked position when the user scrolls near
                enough to a page element. This feature is great for the user since it shows them that there is something
                important or interesting in the current scroll window.

            <h3>Project Goals</h3>
            <p>
                I want the webpage to be dynamic from top to bottom just as Apple did with their page for the iPhone 12
                Pro. I may want to include a scroll lock similar to Chandon Garden's website, however, I'm unsure if
                that will hinder the gallery experience. Also, since this is a webpage primarily meant for displaying
                images I may have to sacrifice some load time for some better quality images. It seems nice websites
                such as Apple's and Chandon's websites also sacrificed load times for exceptional image resolutions. My
                webpage should be more similar to Apple than to Chandon since there is very little typography used in
                their display. I need to present the illustrations in a way that lets them speak for themselves.

            <h3>Design Strategies</h3>
            <p>
                I want the theme for my webpage to echo a similar artistic style to my artworks. This will unify the
                webpage display with the content that I want to share. I might want to go with a medium to dark
                intensity background so that my illustrations pop off the page. For the darker illustrations, I will
                include a very small border so that the edges are clear. Although there is not much text on the page, I
                still think there should be something other than a bland serif or san-serif typeface. Since the genre of
                my illustrations is generally pretty fictional, I've chosen an atypical serif font to pull together the
                theme.

            <h3>Interaction Strategies</h3>
            <p>
                The interactions will be minimal since this will be a gallery webpage. I want the user's scroll to take
                care of all the dynamic interactions so that they don't have to do too much clicking. Hopefully, this
                webpage will be more cinematic than interactive. The only link I have is a link to an ID just below the
                button. During my refinement, I may get rid of this so that the user will understand that they have to
                scroll to see all the content. Not only that, the button makes the parallax animation too quick which
                meant that they didn't get to savor the visuals. Audio feedback won't be as critical in this webpage
                since I want the user to focus on the visuals instead.

            <h3>Experience Goals</h3>
            <p>
                The user experience for this webpage should be relaxing. I want the user to sit back and enjoy the
                content. I don't want to make the user touch anything other than their scroll wheel because I feel as
                though that's the easiest way to navigate a webpage. I think once the user scrolls past the first
                parallax animation I think they will understand that the theme of the page is very dynamic and only
                requires scrolling. I think sometimes pages are too interactive and possibly ask too much of the user,
                so I sort of want this to be the opposite here.
